## Development Flow

1. **Initial Commit** (18:07)
   - Established the project foundation with authentication script, configuration helpers, and documentation

2. **Restart** (20:14)
   - A reset or restructuring of the project

3. **Project Setup** (20:17)
   - Added core project files including the Playwright automation script

4. **Script Enhancement** (22:54)
   - Improved network logging and browser context settings

5. **Core Functionality** (22:58)
   - Implemented credential capture and file saving

6. **File Management** (23:01)
   - Added automatic deletion of saved credentials

7. **Launcher Creation** (23:58)
   - Added a script launcher for easier execution

## GitHub Copilot Impact

### Estimated Development Time Without Copilot
A project of this nature would typically require:

- **Research & Setup**: 2-3 hours (Playwright API, authentication flows)
- **Core Implementation**: 4-6 hours (browser automation, network capture)
- **Debugging & Refinement**: 3-4 hours (handling edge cases, error states)
- **Script Creation & Testing**: 1-2 hours

**Total estimated time without Copilot**: 10-15 hours (1.5-2 work days)

### Time Savings Analysis
- **Estimated time saved**: 4-9 hours (40-60% reduction)
- **Key acceleration areas**:
  - Code scaffolding and boilerplate
  - Playwright-specific API usage
  - Browser detection avoidance techniques
  - Network request interception logic
  - Error handling patterns

### Productivity Benefits
- Reduced context switching between documentation and code
- Faster implementation of standard patterns
- Quicker resolution of syntax issues
- More time spent on core logic vs. boilerplate

The rapid development pace (multiple commits with substantial progress in under 6 hours) strongly suggests that GitHub Copilot significantly accelerated development, allowing completion in a single session what might otherwise have been a multi-day project.
